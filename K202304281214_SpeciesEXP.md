 `K202304281214` IBM1 expression variation at species level 
 
 Key words: `IBM1 othologous` `34 species` `angiosperm` `RNA-seq` `isoform quantification` `methylation demethylation enzyme` 
 
# Question

Intron methylation variation in IBM1 orthologous seems frequently happened across angiosperm species. it is not known that if the intron
methylation in other species can affect IBM1 transcription process as that happened in Arabidopsis. so it would be very worthy to explore 
`short/long isoform expression levels of other species, especielly those within the Eutrema cluster`.

Problem is how to defined short/long isoform in other species? that would be an technique issue to think about. I can start to try from the T.parvula.

I check around 13 species including all 9 species from brassicaciea family and it turned out that T.parvular although have a long intron and almost lost all methylation comparing other species in Bra, it show no sign of short isoform. this observation does not fit with my expectation, since based on my hypothesis, if things consistent with that in Arabidopsis, T.parvular should have a high proportion of short isoform. not just for T.parvular, other species with long intron also show little hint of an alternative short isoform. methylation regulation mechnism seems not affect their transcription process. it seems that the regulation mechnism only hold in arabidopsis.

however, when further think about it, the observation make sense. methylation controled regulated can hardly be a stable mechanism, since DNA methylation is not stable.


so that to summarize, the things I can do is:
1. check the behavious of isoform ratio for the 9 species within bra, propably it is enough for this gene expression analysis.
2. figure out a way to represent the data.
