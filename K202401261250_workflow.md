# Question

1: which workflow language I should learn? how to use them, what is the advantage of them? how to use in combination with condo or other working environment?


# Summary  

I need to learn snake make.

Snakemake was the first I learned, and it's so good that I've never felt the need to learn anything else. Perfect integration with docker, singularity, and conda is what really sells it for me. These days I make a small container for every tool and never have to worry about them after that.


There are several popular bioinformatics workflow managers. A non-exhaustive list includes Nextflow, Snakemake, common workflow language (CWL), and workflow description language (WDL). These workflow managers all provide the necessary capabilities of data provenance, portability, scalability, and re-entrancy. For a more thorough review, see (Wratten et al. 2021).

In data engineering, several graph-based workflow managers are used to run tasks based on a schedule or dependencies. These include Airflow, Flyte, Dagster and Prefect. These tools are simple to wire up to databases and other cloud compute services, and easily scale to manage millions of events.

Interoperability
CWL export
Snakemake workflows can be exported to CWL, such that they can be executed in any CWL-enabled workflow engine. Since, CWL is less powerful for expressing workflows than Snakemake (most importantly Snakemake offers more flexible scatter-gather patterns, since full Python can be used), export works such that every Snakemake job is encoded into a single step in the CWL workflow. Moreover, every step of that workflow calls Snakemake again to execute the job. The latter enables advanced Snakemake features like scripts, benchmarks and remote files to work inside CWL. So, when exporting keep in mind that the resulting CWL file can become huge, depending on the number of jobs in your workflow. To export a Snakemake workflow to CWL
