# Question

Intron methylation variation in IBM1 orthologous seems frequently happened across angiosperm species. it is not known that if the intron
methylation in other species can affect IBM1 transcription process as that happened in Arabidopsis. so it would be very worthy to explore 
`short/long isoform expression levels of other species, especielly those within the Eutrema cluster`.

Problem is how to defined short/long isoform in other species? that would be an technique issue to think about. I can start to try from the T.parvula.

I check around 13 species including all 9 species from brassicaciea family and it turned out that T.parvular although have a long intron and almost lost all methylation comparing other species in Bra, it show no sign of short isoform. this observation does not fit with my expectation, since based on my hypothesis, if things consistent with that in Arabidopsis, T.parvular should have a high proportion of short isoform. not just for T.parvular, other species with long intron also show little hint of an alternative short isoform. methylation regulation mechnism seems not affect their transcription process. it seems that the regulation mechnism only hold in arabidopsis.

however, when further think about it, the observation make sense. methylation controled regulated can hardly be a stable mechanism, since DNA methylation is not stable.

so, it would be an interesting to show the isoform comparision among those 13 species.

on the other hand, although methylation intron may not be a affector in other species, the expression of IBM1 somehow still show some interesting connection with CMTs/KYP in those species. especially in Eutrema and T.arvense, CMT lost/or expression very low, IBM1 expression is also low. B.rapa, B.oleracea also show a low CMT3 and IBM1 expression. species seems have reach their own balance in tuning methylation distribution.
