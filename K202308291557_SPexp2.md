# Question
Although methylation intron may not be a affector in other species, the expression of IBM1 somehow still show some interesting connection with CMTs/KYP in those species. especially in Eutrema and T.arvense, CMT lost/or expression very low, IBM1 expression is also low. B.rapa, B.oleracea also show a low CMT3 and IBM1 expression. species seems have reach their own balance in tuning methylation distribution.

so, the expression pattern of those genes in those species would be also an important result to show.
