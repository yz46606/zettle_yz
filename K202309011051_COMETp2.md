# Main idea

As one of the first steps in analyzing these cell line methylation data, we would like to extract meaningful/interpretable features from the methylation data. The simplest features include global hyper- and hypo- methylation levels and average/median methylation levels at each gene promoter, at 3’/5’ UTRs or in gene bodies.
