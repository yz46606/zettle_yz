# Main idea
exploring Rich's mouse tumor RNA-seq data, to check what BMP signaling expression profile looks like in mouse? the purpose of this
is tring to exploring if the low bmp signaling is the reason why RA-treated mouse model do not work well.


# Results


# Refenence 

I put this pseudobulked GEMM data in the "/groups/geelegrp/home/common/Papers/Min_RetinoicAcid/pseudoBulkedGEMMstuff/" folder.

The non-drug treated samples (which are the ones we are interested in) are as follows: "NB831", "NB837", "NB855", "NB856", "NB864"

There is a simple script here "explorePseudobulkMouse.R" that will calculate TPM values from the counts.

All of the files you need should also be in this folder, but you will need to change some file paths in the script.
