May be it is all over, but I want to record all things happened between 9.17.2023 and 1.12.2024 in this relationship, and think about what I can learn from this relationship.

from August or from May or from March? record everything happened here. and what I thought, what I learned from this.

formal connection 9.17

first three date


first argument?

status in Nov and Dec

the trip and second argument. the final drama between us?

my redeem and his cold reply

my struggle and how emotion changed. what I learned? how to lead a healthy relationship in the future?

update 1.31. I feel much better today. since I think I finally can admit that both of us are imature, it is not good at least at this point to continue bother with each us, it is no good and not healthy. he definetely has his problem, but I am also far from emotional stable. I can not handle him and this relationship. break up and keep the  relationship cool down is the best choice. I will not fight with destiny, it is just not the right time, I will be nature and focus on myself from now on.
