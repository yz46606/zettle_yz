# Question

If there is a significant overlap between the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified from 1-hour RA treatment cell lines by SLAM-seq and SMAD4/9 RARA binding genes? This idea is similar to the analysis of the overlap between DEGs identified from RNA-seq and SMADs/RARA ChIP-seq.

It may be challenging to perform this analysis due to potential issues with the quality of the SLAM-seq data. Therefore, it may not yield reliable results.

To investigate whether SMADs/RARA regulate genes at an early time point of 1-hour RA exposure, it would be beneficial to explore enrichment between SLAM and ChIP-seq in this analysis.

Additionally, it would be helpful to perform function enrichment analysis on the identified SLAM DEGs to investigate major pathway changes at the early time point. This would provide another valuable insight into how these genes are regulated and contribute to the cellular response to RA exposure.
