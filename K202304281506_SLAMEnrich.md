 `K202304281321` Enrichment of SLAM-seq DEGs in SMAD4/9 RARA binding genes
 
 Key words: `DEG differential expression gene` `ChIP-seq` `SLAM-seq` `enrichment` `SMAD9/4` `RARA` 
 
# Question

if differential expressed genes (DEGs) found from 1 hour RA treatment cell lines by SLAM-seq are significantly overlaped with SMAD4/9 RARA binding genes?
Generally, the idea is very similiary to the analysis between DEGs identified from RNA-seq and SMADs RARA ChiP-seq.

the difficulty of this analysis is the problematic SLAM-seq data quality. So it probably not work well.

In this analysis, it would be good to provide both the enrichment exploring between SLAM and ChIP-seq, so that to investigate if SMADs/RARA start regulate genes at a very
early time point of 1 hour RA exposure?

Also, the function enrichment analysis of those SLAM DEGs genes can also be provided, to support the changes can happened very early upon RA.
