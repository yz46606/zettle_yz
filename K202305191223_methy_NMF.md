 `K202305191223` exploring future direction in Cancer DNA methylation field
 
 Key words: `research direction` `interests` 
 
# Thoughts
Since the privous work on SMAD9 project is almost done, so I plan to read and summarize some related papers on the field, and trying to figure out a standing point that 
can connect my previous research record, fit the needs current lab and most importantly, fit my own interests.  

the interests of the lab is neuroblastoma dna methylation NMF decomposition profile, method developement.  
my previous experience is population level DNA methylation variation.  
my interests is the interaction of genetic and DNA methylation variation, the interplay between methylation and other NGS data, especially genetic variation data, the influence of DNA methylation on gene regulation and evolution. how its changes is related to disease, phenotype changes
