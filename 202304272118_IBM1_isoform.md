# main context

## question

I want to test if RNA-seq can measure IBM1 isoform expression in different methylation mutant lines.

if true, the ratio of short and long IBM1 isoform should match with expectation. 
such as in mutants (suv456, cmt3, met1) that have a methylation reduction in IBM1 7th introns, long isoform shoule be lower to WT.

however, in mutants that with unaffected intron methylation, long isoform should be comparable to WT.
