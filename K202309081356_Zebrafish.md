# Main idea
exploring genetic mutation induced zebrafish tumor RNA-seq data, to check what BMP signaling expression profile looks like in zebrafish? the purpose of this
is tring to exploring why RA drug seems works well in zebrafish, can that be explained by BMP signaling expression profile?

From what I understand, the BMP-Smad signaling pathway in zebrafish is very much conserved when compared to that in human. I did a bit work for Suzy Baker’s lab to show the ACVR1 mutation in DIPG activate the BMP signaling. It’s reasonable to expect BMP signaling at the RNA level will be affected in zebrafish tumors if you see that in human tumors. Here are two more articles for you to look at:

Unfortunately there are no models of ACVR1 activated DIPG models available so far. You may have known that ACVR1 activated BMP cause Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) in human and mouse. A chemical that works on the gamma subtypes of retinoic-acid receptors has just been approved by FDA to treat FOP. Not sure whether this is relevant to your question.
