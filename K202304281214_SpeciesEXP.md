 `K202304281214` IBM1 expression variation at species level 
 
 Key words: `IBM1 othologous` `34 species` `angiosperm` `RNA-seq` `isoform quantification` `methylation demethylation enzyme` 
 
# Question

Intron methylation variation in IBM1 orthologous seems frequently happened across angiosperm species. it is not known that if the intron
methylation in other species can affect IBM1 transcription process as that happened in Arabidopsis. so it would be very worthy to explore 
`short/long isoform expression levels of other species, especielly those within the Eutrema cluster`.

Problem is how to defined short/long isoform in other species? that would be an technique issue to think about. I can start to try from the T.parvula.

Another thoughts may usefull is that, `if gene expression level of enzymes in the CHG methylation pathway can reflect the phylogeny of those species`? it true, it could be an supportive to the accuracy of RNA-seq data comparison accross species. also,the intron methylation could be a explaination for exceptions that not follow expected clustering.
