 the investigation is for Arabidopsis mutants  

# main context

## question

I want to test if RNA-seq can measure IBM1 isoform expression in different methylation mutant lines.

if true, the ratio of short and long IBM1 isoform should match with expectation. 
such as in mutants (suv456, cmt3, met1) that have a methylation reduction in IBM1 7th introns, long isoform shoule be lower to WT.

however, in mutants that with unaffected intron methylation, long isoform should be comparable to WT.

## results summary

the results is as expected. [202304272340_worklog](https://github.com/yz46606/Working_record/blob/main/202304272340_worklog.md)

the interesting tendency is that long isoform level tend to decrease in suv456, cmt3, met1, while short isoform level is similar as WT.

it seems that long isoform is decable to form, they will directly disapear totally instead of keep the part before the 7th intron. but I do not
know if that is true or not.
