# Question
Although methylation intron may not be a affector in other species, the expression of IBM1 somehow still show some interesting connection with CMTs/KYP in those species. especially in Eutrema and T.arvense, CMT lost/or expression very low, IBM1 expression is also low. B.rapa, B.oleracea also show a low CMT3 and IBM1 expression. species seems have reach their own balance in tuning methylation distribution.

so, the expression pattern of those genes in those species would be also an important result.

# Analysis Plan
1. preparing gene expression data for each species
2. preparing methylation status on genes for each species. preparing gbM number and proportion for each species.
3. find orthologous gene id for CMT3,CMT1 and KYP4 across investigated species. and extract gene expression based on those geneid;
   a. extract gene id from each gene tree
   b. convert them into a readable list
   
5. make a species tree from public database and order species based on that.list the barplot for 4 gene expression, then providing gbM proportion
