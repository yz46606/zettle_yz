 `K202304281321` Enrichment of differential express genes in SMAD4/9 RARA binding genes
 
 Key words: `DEG differential expression gene` `ChIP-seq` `RNA-seq` `enrichment` `SMAD9/4` `RARA` 
 
# Question

if differential expressed genes upon RA exposure is significantly overlaped with SMAD4/9 binding genes. if so,
how to measure this significance? 

I plan to use fisher-exact test to measure the significancy of enrichment.
