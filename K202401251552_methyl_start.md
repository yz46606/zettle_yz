# Question

1: Work with Charlie to figure out what we already have, where is the data etc.

 

2: look into getting Xiangâ€™s pipeline run on our data: https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02220-y

 

3: look into figuring out what methylation data was already generated at the Sanger Institute, e.g. how many pediatric cell lines, how many neuroblastoma, how many with paired drug data, how many with paired CRISPR data, can the data be easily accessed etc: https://www.cancerrxgene.org/downloads/bulk_download

 

Adding to #2, is there any other public data we could fold into our analysis, what paper might we have missed etc? the paper use WGBS, so what about different microarray data? 450, 850, 950 etc.
