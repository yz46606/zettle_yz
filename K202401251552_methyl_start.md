# Question and goals discussed with Paul

1: Work with Charlie to figure out what we already have, where is the data etc.

 

2: look into getting Xiang’s pipeline run on our data: https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02220-y

 

3: look into figuring out what methylation data was already generated at the Sanger Institute, e.g. how many pediatric cell lines, how many neuroblastoma, how many with paired drug data, how many with paired CRISPR data, can the data be easily accessed etc: https://www.cancerrxgene.org/downloads/bulk_download

PeDep currently do not have methylation data and comet have 300 methylation data, but have no other matched drug or crispr data, so not very useful.  
 

Adding to #2, is there any other public data we could fold into our analysis, what paper might we have missed etc? the paper use WGBS, so what about different microarray data? 450, 850, 950 etc.


4: 

 for some of these cell lines where it is ambiguous what it is, there will likely be much more information available on Cellosaurus: 
https://www.cellosaurus.org/

CRISPR data seems to be here. The Sanger’s CRSPR data is also probably (mostly) available on DepMap.org (but its hard to know exactly what has been moved where….).

 cosmic cell line data

Drug = Temozolomide. Gene = MGMT. MGMT “promotor methylation” should predict Temozolomide sensitivity (IC50).

 

CRISPR data from Broad Institute (DepMap) is here: DepMap Data Downloads

Info/paper From Anang Shelat about MGMT:

 

Here are two papers describing the use of methylation data to predict MGMT status and response to TMZ.

 

MGMT methylation analysis of glioblastoma on the Infinium methylation BeadChip identifies two distinct CpG regions associated with gene silencing and outcome, yielding a prediction model for comparisons across datasets, tumor grades, and CIMP-status

Sensitivity Analysis of the MGMT-STP27 Model and Impact of Genetic and Epigenetic Context to Predict the MGMT Methylation Status in Gliomas and Other Tumors

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525157816000477?via%3Dihub#bib11

 

The actual model is a simple logistic regression using 2 probe sites M-scores:

Logit(y) = 4:3215 + 0.5271 * cg12434587 + 0:9265 * cg12981137


# work plans

1. figure out the largest dataset I can use for the project, what are they and where are they and how to use them 

   Decided to use the dataset from GDSC paper, it has the most curated dataset I can use. then consider find some WGBS data for comparison with microarray. familiar with the general pipeline and anaysis for those different types of NGS datasets in cancer cell lines. familar with commonly used softwared for methylation analysis in cancer and microarrary, and its integrative analysis with other types of data.

2. figure out the MGMT and TMZ relation hold, do the test using previous method and collected public data.
   
figure out the priciple of that MGMT prediction model, thinking about how to adjust it to our situation. to be honest, it is hard to understand for me now.....
   
4. work on the promoter activity predection software, and search for other available method and pipeline for promoter activity prediction.
   work with M2A pipline and find other available packages.
M2A   M2A is a machine learning framework that uses convolutional neural networks to infer promoter activities based on H3K4me3 and DNA methylation data. 
MethylNet MethylNet is an automated and modular deep learning approach for analyzing DNA methylation data. It focuses on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression programs that can be altered by various factors, including environmental exposures and aging. 
MethGET A web-based bioinformatics software for correlating genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression. 
DIRECTION:  machine learning framework for predicting and understanding the epigenome, including DNA methylation and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) status at single-nucleotide resolution. While not directly mentioned as a gene expression predictor, DIRECTION's capabilities in epigenomic prediction could contribute to studies on the relationship between DNA methylation, hydroxymethylation, and gene expression​
Enformer:  Reported by Nature, Enformer is a deep learning architecture designed for substantially improving gene expression prediction accuracy from DNA sequences. It integrates information over large genomic regions, potentially including epigenetic marks like DNA methylation, to predict gene expression levels​
   
6. undertand the pedep project, general goal, the part charged by paul, and what could be my standing point. considering the including of as much genetic data types as possible.

   need to read those materials, a lot of work need to do.
   
8. figure out my specific project goal and working plan. by doing the literature research and reading, geting to do the newest progress in the erea and backgrounds. then writing a specific working plan in the form of grant.
   
think about a significant , applicable goal that fit the need of everyone, and can sytify myself's interest in understanding and integrating genomic data to inteprete biological questions.
   
10. working out a effectient project manage system, and improve the coding stills.
11. make progress every two weeks.

# background

GDSC1000 cell lines, all cell line and associated meta-data are identified by a unique cosmic ID. Cosmic ID is from cosmic project. COSMIC, the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer, is the world's largest and most comprehensive resource for exploring the impact of somatic mutations in human cancer. cell lines are grouped by tissue descriptions and by using TCGA tumor type. The genome annotaion of GDSC 1000 cell lines include exonme sequencing, expression, CNA, DNA methylation, Gene fusions and Microsatellite instability.

GDSC1 and GDSC2 are two large scale drug screen project, highly overlaped, if duplicate IC50s exist, the result from GDSC2 is recommend to use. IC50 and AUC curve are used for drug Dose-response measurement. 

ANOVA, to identify genomic features associated with drug response an analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to correlate drug response (IC50 values) with genomic alterations in cancer cells.


GDSC : drug screen
COSMIC: somatic mutation in cancer
TCGA: cancer genomics program for tumors
Depmap: CRISPR data, exploring gene dependency of different cell lines

# Scientific questions



if pediatric cancer cell has more methylation variation than adult cells?

need to familar with the gobal methylation distribution in human tumor and cancer cells. what the generally shape looks like, most CG are methylated except for some CpG island in promoter? how variable about methylation on those CG island comparing to other region? 

for the same cell line, if it has both WGBS and microarray data, compare how different are they in capture methylation features.

the distribution of differentially methylated sites in different cancer types, and if it more often in pediatric cancer comparing to mutation frequency.

The assocations between DNA methylation and histone modification, gene expression, mutation, structure variation, drug response and crispr gene dependency, protein activity?


how many assocation between DNA methylation and gene expression, drug response are pediatric specific? how many of them are more universally hold? 

any method to improve the testing specificy and accuracy? can we use the promoter activity from M2A or other package (not sure now) to better capture the DNA methylation features and better performance in drug reponse assiociation?


above are questions I want to know, figure out those general questions and the current answer and unclarity about those general questions, then based on those to narrow down to specific questions and goals that can satisfy the need of pedep and mine own desire and interests. narrow down to future directions. think about how to including the gene depenency map to the analysis.

it is needed to familiar with common piplines for those different types of genomic data, and figure out ways to integrete all of them together. learing about deep learing method, python, and think about
