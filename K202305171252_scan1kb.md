`K202305171252` scan the arabidopsis genome for >1kb mCHG introns and identify how many of them are affected by methylation reduction

# Question

Intron methylation and its effects on transcription is not specifically limited to IBM1, it would be interesting to scan the Arabidopsis genome
and find all methylated long introns (>1kb), and check how many of them have methylation reduction in cmt3/met1/suv456 mutants, and produce more
incomplete transcripts. how many of those genes also overlap with IBM2 mutants.

another exploring is to see how many of those methylation reduction introns also happened in cnt1 for example, and further more, behivious at population level.
