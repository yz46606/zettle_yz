# Thoughts

Itai Yanai is one of the most creative and influential thinkers in Computational Biology.

He also runs a very popular podcast: https://night-science.org/the-night-science-podcast/.

I heard a talk from him 2 month ago on Feb 14. I thought his research is interesting, and he seems have a similar education background as me. I mean begin bioinformatics from

molecular evolution and then tend to human cancer. It is possible that I can get some inspiration and idea from his path and research. it must be good for my

future path.
