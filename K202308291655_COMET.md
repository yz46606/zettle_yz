 `K202308291655` The COMET DNA methylation atlas of pediatric solid tumors can be used as a biological reference map for cell free DNA and preclinical models. 
 
 Key words: `Comet` `pediatric solid tumors ` `cell line` `preclinical models` `cell free DNA` `DNA methylation` `whole genome sequencing`
 
 
# Main idea

use Comet data as a reference to assess the quanlity of preclinial samples and their tumor origion, so the drug response biomarker found from cell lines could be used to 
guide clinical trials in patient tumor.

# background
The Comprehensive Methylation (COMET) dataset has collected DNA methylation data from almost 10,000 pediatric solid tumors, offering unprecedented insights into the epigenetic landscape of these tumors and discovering novel pediatric cancer subtypes. 

In this study, by generating 100s of additional DNA methylation profiles across cell lines, PDXs and cfDNA, we have demonstrated that the COMET dataset can be used as a suitable reference map for pediatric solid tumors. 

strategies for prioritizing or deprioritizing cell lines for extremely-labor-and-cost-intensive perturbational screening? what does it means?

# potential directions
how to combine methylation, genomic variation and drug response? and selecting for some interpretable biomarkers
